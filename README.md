# **Vacation Suggester**

*Exercise for Epicodus, 02/24/2017*

**By Joshua Fairchild**

### Description
This is a webpage designed to gather input from the user, then suggest one of several vacation destinations considering the answers that the user provided. Questions are displayed one at a time with subsequent questions being displayed when the user presses the "Next Question" button (in addition to hiding the answered question). If the user makes an invalid entry for a question, they will get an "error" message asking them to provide a valid answer. Once the user is suggested a destination they will have the option to clear all of the forms and go through the question set again, *ad infinitum*.
